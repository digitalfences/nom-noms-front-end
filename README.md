#NomNoms Recipe and Kitchen management
NomNoms is an app for helping bring gourmet culinary insight to your kitchen.
Have you ever opened your pantry or fridge to see tons of ingredients staring back at you, but have nothing spark your interest?
Do you buy groceries and then discover that you never find the time to use them before they rot?
Do you sometimes struggle to co-ordinate with roommates or spouse to know what ingredients need to be restocked or picked up at the store?
Are you interested in reducing your time at the grocery store and improving your enjoyment of the food you make, reducing waste and expense on delivered food and restaurants?

This app is especially for people who want a step up in owning their relationship with food.
